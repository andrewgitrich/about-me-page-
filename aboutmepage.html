                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>Hi there, My name is Andrew Rich.  I am a self educating in the field of  web development and looking to make great things at a wonderful company.  I have grown up in blue collar city and developed a hell of a work ethic because of it.  For example while I was finishing my degree full time, I was learning how to remodel a condo I was living in and working a job 35 hours a week.</p>
                <p>My work background includes sales, management and customer service experience.  My degrees are in General management and Human Resource Management.  But they have not been as fruitful for me as I hoped they would be, hence the new path toward an exciting new career.</p>

                <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
                <p>I hail from the “steel city” of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  Well, I really grew up roughly 20 minutes north of the city but...  I am the second to last born of five children, (three brothers and a sister) and I wouldn't trade in all the times I was beat up for anything, it helped made me who I me today. Pittsburgh is known for its sports teams (Go Steelers, Pirates and Penguins), bridges, (3 more than the city of Venice, 446 in total) and a really cool emergence of a tech and tech companies.</p>

                <h1>More About Me</h1>
                <h2>Hobbies?</h2>
                <p>I enjoy mountain biking with friends either through the vast trails of hills through the parks, or around the city on a relaxing  impromptu beer ride.  watching my nieces and nephews grow is a really cool experience since I get to hang out with them without changing diapers.  I really love to learn and I consider it a hobby.  What do I like to learn you may ask, anything!  It could be anything from cooking sous vide style to trying to understand how qubits work in quantum computing.
</p>
                <h2>What is your dream job?</h2>
                <p>My dream job isn't very specific as far as a position or company.  Although, I can say that I want to work somewhere I can create something that would help someone or at least be of some sort of good use.  Work with people that are engaged in their work, have work life balance and be paid enough so I don't need to worry if i'll have enough money this month to fix the car, buy a gift for someone's birthday, or <strong>groceries!</strong>
</p>
                <h2>If you had all the free time and money you could ask for what would you do?</h2>
                <p>I would travel first.  Not just to see the world but to meet the people.  There are so many cultures out there and I would love to experience them firsthand.  Also I want to solve a real world problem.  I don't think realistically that I would solve something like homelessness but something more significant than a cold toilet seat in the winter.  Also I would like to hike the Appalachian trail and a cross country road trip</p>
                <h2>How do you live your life?</h2>
                <p><em>Work like hell,</em> and take days one at a time.  I try to think about the future more than the past.  We can't change the past, only how we feel about it.  I try to keep the best attitude I can and a simple way to do this to keep things in perspective.  Anytime you think things in your life are bad, one must think of the man living under a bridge, someone in bad health or a child in a poor country that dosent have access to clean water.  </p>
